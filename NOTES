OVERVIEW
---------
Users will submit information about their gear to be stored in a database for later reference.
This information will have to be very specific in order for GearHub to use Reverb's API and return price information.
We will accomplish this by requiring specific information on the gear entry form.
The information from the gear entry form will be used to query Reverb's endpoint described below:

https://api.reverb.com/api/listings/all

These parameters/form data MUST include:

Brand: Brand (i.e., Roland)
Model: Model (i.e., Juno 106)
Category: {Category Slug From API Categories, see ./ReverbJSON/categories.json} (analog-synths)

This criteria will later be used to obtain the price ID for saved equipment, which will then be used to display information from the price guide.  The above values will be concatenated and then provided as the search query.  This limits results to ensure that the price_guide_id is accurate.

Users will also be able to save their serials, photographs and item descriptions.
This information is valuable to musicians because these are very expensive items and there is a lot of theft on tour. Other information like condition will be important for integration with Reverb when they eventually buy this from me!!

Later, this can be extended to LPs.
